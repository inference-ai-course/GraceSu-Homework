    "# Week 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with arXiv Papers\n",
    "This week marks a major shift in your AI agent's capabilities: youâ€™ll build the foundation for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored to scientific research. Rather than relying on an LLMâ€™s memory alone, RAG architectures allow your agent to search a structured knowledge base and generate grounded, document-aware answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a RAG pipeline using recent arXiv cs.CL papers, converting them into searchable chunks, embedding them, and indexing them with FAISS. Youâ€™ll then implement a simple query interface that takes a user question, retrieves the top relevant chunks, and displays them for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week marks the beginning of building your agentâ€™s private research knowledge baseâ€”a semantic index that youâ€™ll evolve into a full-featured hybrid database in Week 5."

    "## Project Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will guide you through building a RAG pipeline on arXiv cs.CL papers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection:** Obtain 50 arXiv cs.CL PDFs (you can scrape via the arXiv API or use a provided sample set).\n",
    "2. **Text Extraction:** Extract raw text from each PDF (for example, using PyMuPDF's `get_text()` on each page). Clean and concatenate the page text into full-document strings.\n",
    "3. **Text Chunking:** Split each paper into chunks (â‰¤ 512 tokens each). You might split at section boundaries or use a sliding-window approach (e.g., 500-token windows with overlap). Chunking into smaller, meaningful segments (around 250â€“512 tokens) often yields better retrieval precision.\n",
    "4. **Embedding Generation:** Compute dense vector embeddings for each chunk. For instance, using the `sentence-transformers` library:"

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "   (Alternatively, you can use a Hugging Face Transformer model and apply pooling manually to get chunk embeddings.)\n",
    "5. **Indexing with FAISS:** Build a FAISS index of the chunk embeddings. For example, use a simple index like `IndexFlatL2` with the same dimensionality as your embeddings. Add all chunk vectors to the index (e.g., `index.add(np.array(embeddings))`).\n",
    "6. **Notebook Demo:** Create a notebook where a user query is embedded and passed to the index (`index.search(query_embedding, k)`) to retrieve the top-3 matching chunks. Display the original chunk text for these results.\n",
    "7. **FastAPI Service:** Build a simple FastAPI app. Define an endpoint (e.g. `@app.get(\"/search\")`) that accepts a query parameter `q`. In the handler, embed `q`, perform the FAISS search, and return the top passages as JSON. (For example, a FastAPI endpoint can accept a question and return relevant documents.)\n"

    "## Student Exploration Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* Experiment with different chunk sizes and overlaps. Smaller chunks (âˆ¼250 tokens) often give more precise retrieval, while larger chunks include more context.\n",
    "* Try different embedding models (e.g. using `'all-mpnet-base-v2'` or `'paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2'`) to see how retrieval results change.\n",
    "* Implement a simple reranking step: for example, after retrieving candidates with FAISS, re-score them with a cross-encoder model for finer ranking.\n",
    "* Use metadata: consider filtering or weighting chunks by paper metadata (e.g. year, authors, keywords) to improve relevance if needed.\n"
